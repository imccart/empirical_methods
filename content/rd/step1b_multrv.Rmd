So far, our discussion of the RD design has focused on a single running variable and an exogenous assignment to treatment.  However, in many empirical settings, a treatment assignment may be based on multiple underlying scores.  @cattaneo2020stata points to research where school admission is based on both reading and math scores.  Another example is @keele2015geographic, which uses treatment assignment based on geographic location defined by latitude and longitude.  There is a relatively new area of literature that proposes methodologies for this sort of analysis which may provide helpful solutions for your context [@cattaneo2020stata; @papay2011extending; @reardon2012regression].
