<p>So far, our discussion of the RD design has focused on a single running variable and an exogenous assignment to treatment. However, in many empirical settings, a treatment assignment may be based on multiple underlying scores. <span class="citation">Cattaneo, Titiunik, and Vazquez-Bare (2020)</span> points to research where school admission is based on both reading and math scores. Another example is <span class="citation">Keele and Titiunik (2015)</span>, which uses treatment assignment based on geographic location defined by latitude and longitude. There is a relatively new area of literature that proposes methodologies for this sort of analysis which may provide helpful solutions for your context <span class="citation">(Cattaneo, Titiunik, and Vazquez-Bare 2020; Papay, Willett, and Murnane 2011; Reardon and Robinson 2012)</span>.</p>
