So here you are, facing an endogeneity problem, a bit more familiar with RD, and gearing up to use this methodology in your context.  But wait, while RD may seem like the sprinkle of econometric magic you're looking for, it's possible that it may just not be well-suited to your context.

Fortunately, there are tools and tests that you can use to determine whether or not RD is appropriate! Click on the links below to get more detail on each part of this step, or go back to the [flowchart](/rd/flowchart).

1. [Running Variable](/rd/step1_rv): Our running variable must be continuous and must determine assignment to treatment.

2. [Manipulation](/rd/step1_manipulation): Our treatment status must not be manipulated.

3. [Covariate Balance](/rd/step1_covarbal): The observations on either side of the cutoff must be comparable with the exception of treatment status.
