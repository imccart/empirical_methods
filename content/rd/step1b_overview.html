<p>If you’re here, it means that you’ve assessed your running variable, you can say pretty confidently that your treatment status isn’t manipulated, and your covariates are well balanced. Further, you’ve identified that your context has a <strong>strict</strong> discontinuity. But does it have just <em>one</em> strict discontinuity? Multiple discontinuities? Do you have multiple running variables?</p>

<p>Whatever your case, you have options. Click on the link that best describes your context so that you can better understand how to construct your analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="/rd/step1b_one">One/Pooled</a>: You either have one cutoff, or multiple cutoffs that you can group together at treat as one.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/rd/step1b_mult">Multiple</a>: In this case, you have multiple cutoffs and you want to keep them separate.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/rd/step1b_multrv">Multiple Running Variables</a>: You have multiple running variables that determine your assignment to treatment.</p></li>
