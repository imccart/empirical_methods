With all of the recent developments in methods for applied empirical micro, it can be difficult to keep everything organized. Should I try synthetic control? I have an instrument, but what tests should I run? How sensitive are my IV results to outliers or to weak instruments? What was the name of that RD test again, and why do some people bin the outcome first?

I put these diagrams and links together to help me keep some of this straight. These aren't comprehensive, but I think they serve as a decent reference for the key things to keep in mind, standard tests to consider, and alternative estimators (when relevant). I'm updating these things constantly as I find new information and correct my own misunderstanding. If you see something awry, please [let me know](#contact)!
