For the most part, this material is just a re-organization of various different resources. A few folks have been particularly generous with their time and course materials, especially:

- [Dan Millimet](https://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/): Dan is awesome. I think he's shared all of his econometrics lecture notes with me at some point. For us metrics mortals, he is a medium to the real econometricians. The IV section in particular benefitted from his notes.

- [Kaylyn Sanbower](https://kaylynrsanbower.netlify.app/): Kaylyn is a graduate student at Emory and helped put together a lot of this material. Hire her soon because she's incredibly talented and creative and hard-working.

To all of you, I say...
