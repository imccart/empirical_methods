So you think you have an endogeneity problem and want to solve it with IV? Well, IV comes with its own problems too. For one, it's biased (although that can be fixed with some assumptions). It's also a very sensitive approach. IV used to be the darling of empirical work, but not so much anymore. 

I'm assuming you have some instrument(s) in mind already, at least as many as you have endogenous variables.
