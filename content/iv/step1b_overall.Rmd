If you're here, it means you're uncomfortable with some of the required IV assumptions. Either you have some statistical evidence that your assumptions may not hold, or you suspect some violation of assumptions that you can't test (e.g., the exogeneity assumption in a just-identified model). Or maybe you think everything is great but a reviewer thinks otherwise.

Either way, the goal now is to consider treatment effect estimates that are robust to violations of some of the key IV assumptions. Click on the links below for more detail:

1. [First stage](/iv/step2_firststage): Weak instruments

2. [Exogeneity](/iv/step2_exog): Instruments are also endogenous

3. [Excludability](/iv/step2_exclude): The instrument directly affects the outcome
