<p>The exclusion restriction says that your instruments do not directly affect your outcome, so that it is appropriately “excluded” from the main equation of interest. This assumption goes by different names and is sometimes combined with other IV assumptions. For example, sometimes you see this assumption lumped into the first stage requirement and stated as an “only-through” assumption (i.e., the instrument affects the outcome only through the endogenous variable of interest).</p>
<p>Regardless, the exclusion restriction is hard to test because the instrument should also be correlated with the endogenous variable. If you have an overidentified model, then you can test the exclusion restriction alongside the exogeneity assumption for a subset of instruments.</p>
