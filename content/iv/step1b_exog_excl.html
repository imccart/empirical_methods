<p>No matter how great you think your instrument is, your data may say otherwise. Maybe your “zero-first-stage” test fails, or maybe you have an overidentified model and you reject your Sargan or Hansen’s <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> test. Whatever the reason, you’re here because you’re starting to suspect that your instruments aren’t all you’d hoped.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that you still have a strong first stage. If not, then you may need another estimation strategy altogether.</p>
