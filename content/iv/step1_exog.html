<p>Unfortunately, this is again an area where I’ve already oversold the topic. In general, we can’t test for instrument exogeneity. It’s just one of those assumptions that we have to maintain if we’re going to use IV.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. We can (somewhat) test this assumption if we have more instruments than we do endogenous variables (i.e., if we have an overidentified model). With homoskedastic errors, we run a Sargan test, and with heteroskedastic errors, we use the Hansen’s <em>J</em> test. These are overidentification tests, and the null in each test is that your instruments are exogenous. Rejecting the null therefore suggests we might have a problem. But failing to reject the null doesn’t necessarily mean exogeneity holds. So, there’s that.</p>
